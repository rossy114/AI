# Overview

This is the code for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYQAI6Td2wo) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval on Sensor Networks. We can imagine sensors as a grid, then use the bellman equation to compute the optimal policy to get from Router A to Router B as efficinetly as possible. Implementations of MDP value iteration, MDP policy iteration, and Q-Learning in a toy grid-world setting.

## Dependencies 

* matplotlib
